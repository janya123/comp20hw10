    <p> The API that I selected randomly generates a meal and provides information
        about it, such as the category of food and the cuisine. I found this
        on the Reading links given to us by Lisa, one of which was the GitHub
        list of Public and Free APIs. I printed a meal as well as the type
        (called "strCategory" in the database) followed by the cuisine
        (called "strCuisine" in the database). One use of this API is if
        someone wants to generate meal ideas, the second is if someone
        wants to explore new cuisines and categories of food and would like
        to generate data surrounding that.
